release-flow-test
=================

Repository for testing development flow.

Before we get everyone involved, a baseline set of files will be put in place. Announcements  via the email
reflector <lwg@lists.accellera.org> will be forthcoming on when the actual testing will begin. 

GOAL: To exercise as much of the documented/proposed release flow as possible.
