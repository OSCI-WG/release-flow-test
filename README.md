release-flow-test
=================

Repository for testing development flow. The focus of this repository is testing/experiencing the release flow described in [DEVELOPMENT.md](file:docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)

Before we get everyone involved, a baseline set of files will be put in place. Announcements  via the email
reflector <lwg@lists.accellera.org> will be forthcoming on when the actual testing will begin. 

**GOAL:** To exercise as much of the documented/proposed release flow as possible.

**NOTE:** Documentation is being maintained as MarkDown format to keep it simple.
